You can create or purchase a HybridDB for PostgreSQL instance by using one of the following methods:

This document describes the detailed steps for creating a HybridDB for PostgreSQL instance in the console.

You have registered an account and signed up.

## Procedure { .section}

1.  Log on the [HybridDB for PostgreSQL console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/gpdb).
2.  Click **Create Instance**.

3.  Select the instance configuration. The options include:

    -   Region and zone: for guidance on how to select, see [Regions and zones](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/40654.htm).

    -   Engine: the database type. Only supports **Storage Included**.

    -   Instance Class: the instance type. It is the unit of computing resources. Different classes have different storage spaces and computing capabilities. For details, see [Instance types](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance types.md#).

    -   Instance Groups: the number of purchased instances. The minimum is two. More groups provide higher linear performance.

4.  Confirm your order information, and then click **Buy Now**.

5.  Click **Activate** to activate the instance.

6.  Go to the **Instance List** page of [HybridDB for PostgreSQL console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/gpdb) to view the newly created instance.


**Note:** The instance initialization takes some time. You can perform subsequent operations only after the instance status becomes Running.
