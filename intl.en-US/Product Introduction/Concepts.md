# Concepts {#concept_emc_dfr_52b .concept}

The following table lists the basic concepts involved in HybridDB for PostgreSQL.

|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Group|The operation unit in HybridDB for PostgreSQL.-   A HybridDB for PostgreSQL instance is composed of multiple groups.
-   Increasing the number of groups can improve the linear performance.

|
|Group type|The package of computing resources available.-   Each group type includes CPU, I/O, memory, and disk resources. Different group types have different performance.
-   Resources in one group are allocated to the same physical host.

|
|Number of groups|The number of purchased groups.-   The minimum unit is two.
-   Each group type has different group number limit.

|
|MPP|Massively Parallel Processing, a distributed Shared Nothing computing architecture. MPP improves the performance by parallel computing of multiple shared-nothing nodes \(known as groups in HybridDB for PostgreSQL\).|
